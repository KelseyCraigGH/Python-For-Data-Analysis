<strong>Objective</strong>

The objective of this project is for students to get hands-on experience working on robust data analysis projects with the goal of recommending actionable insights using data from a domain they are interested in. These projects are also meant to serve as a peer-reviewed addition to students' coding portfolios so they can walk away from this course with a GitHub-worthy example of their Python knowledge (or at least something to talk about in a future interview!)

<strong>Project Requirements</strong>

One Python notebook should be submitted and a data source file. 

Each project should have the following sections:

Introduction/ Objective of the project and script (Markdown) 
Data Exploration & Cleaning (Markdown and Code)
Data Analysis (Markdown and Code)
Data Visualizations (Markdown and Code)
Recommendations (Markdown)
*Does not have to be in this order

<strong>Grading Rubric</strong>

Everyone in a group will receive the same grade. The group project is worth 100 points (compared to a weekly assignment which is worth 20). However, the group assignment is not meant to be 5x the work of an individual assignment for each group member. Instead, the higher points are meant to reflect the weekly effort this assignment will require as students go through the different modules and build on their python skills. This project should be worked on throughout the course as you learn the material -- do not wait until week 5 to get started.
